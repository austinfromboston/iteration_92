To introduce the strategy, explain to students that visualizing is picturing details from the text to increase understanding. Begin with a brief read aloud. Have students close their eyes and picture what’s happening in the reading with as many details as they can. Then have students talk about what they visualized. 

Then explain that you are going to do a quick sketch of what you visualized. Making your sketch unpolished will help emphasize for your students that they should work quickly and not concern themselves with artistic quality. 

To build the connection between visual details and higher-level meaning, ask questions to draw out the students’ interpretation of the picture. Then share your interpretation. Model how visual details connect with key concepts and themes. Reinforce how specific details support larger ideas. {Why did I draw this picture? What does it mean? What details are important? What does this show about the subject, character, main idea, theme, etc.?} 

Next, move to guided practice. Read aloud another passage and allow students to sketch their interpretation while listening. In pairs or groups of three, have students take turns sharing their pictures and having the group members offer their interpretations.  Students should not explain their own pictures until all other group members have commented. As a whole group, discuss how visualizing helps them understand the text. {How did visualizing help them understand the text? Did the interpretations vary? How does reading differ when they do not visualize versus when they do?}

For independent practice, allow students to sketch while reading and answering comprehension questions. Require students to cite the text to support their answer. You may even ask them to include quotes from the text on their drawings. If students are in an assessment situation, encourage them to picture what they are reading instead of drawing a picture. {What does this description tell us about the character or subject? What type of mood do the visual details create? Based on the visual details, what predictions or inferences can be made?}
